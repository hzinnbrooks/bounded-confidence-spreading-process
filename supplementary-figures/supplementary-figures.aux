We do not see qualitative differences in this figure when $x_0$ is changed; compare to Figure 6 in the manuscript where $x=0.5$. The solid curves give means across $1000$ realizations, and the shaded regions give the standard deviations. In each realization, we generate a 2000-node configuration-model network with a degree sequence from a Poisson distribution with mean $\lambda $. We vary $\lambda $ from $1$ to $40$ in increments of $1$. Each realization has different initial node opinions, which we draw uniformly at random from $(0,1)$. The receptiveness parameter is $c = 0.2$. In each realization, we draw a new degree sequence and a new set of node opinions.}}{1}\protected@file@percent }
